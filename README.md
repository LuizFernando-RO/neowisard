#A bit about WiSARD

WiSARD is a Weightless Neural Network model created by Wilkie, Stonham and Aleksander in 1984. It's also called a multidiscriminator RAM-based model.

Basic WiSARD takes a binary x by y input - referred as retina - and creates a pseudo-random mapping between a set of n pixels - or n-tuples - and an address of a RAM memory. The address if formed from the concatanation of the values stored in the pixels.

WiSARD's main advantage is the extremely fast training phase.

#A bit about Transfer Learning

Consider a situation where a person faces a problem similar to another problem it has previously faced. To solve the current problem, the person takes the expecience obtained from the old problem and tries to aplly it. In other words, the person has transfered what was learned in one context to another.
